# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the following Projects:

-   Palindrome Checker
-   Roman Numeral Converter
-   Caesar's Cipher
-   Telephone Number Validator
-   Cash Register

## Overview

-   **Palindrome Checker:** This project taught me the importance of writing clean and readable code. I learned to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks and write code to solve each of them.
    
-   **Roman Numeral Converter:** This project helped me understand how to work with arrays, loops and conditional statements. I also learned the importance of testing my code with various edge cases to ensure its reliability.
    
-   **Caesar's Cipher:** This project was a great exercise in using arrays and loops to manipulate strings. I learned how to create a simple encryption algorithm and how to handle special characters in strings.
    
-   **Telephone Number Validator:** This project taught me the importance of using regular expressions and their applications in validating user input. I learned how to write regular expressions to match different patterns in a string.
    
-   **Cash Register:** This project was a great introduction to working with objects and using control structures like loops and conditional statements. I learned how to calculate change to be returned to a customer, and how to handle situations where the cash register may not have enough change.
