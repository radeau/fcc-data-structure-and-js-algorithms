# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

[![Certificate](/img/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures.png 'JS Certificate for Algorithm and Data Structure')](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/radeau/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)

This repository contains my solutions to the following Projects:

-   Palindrome Checker
-   Roman Numeral Converter
-   Caesar's Cipher
-   Telephone Number Validator
-   Cash Register

## Overview

-   **Palindrome Checker:**  A program that checks if a given string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward.
    
-   **Roman Numeral Converter:** A program that converts an integer to its equivalent Roman numeral representation.
    
-   **Caesar's Cipher:** A program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter with a letter shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet.
    
-   **Telephone Number Validator:** A program that validates a given telephone number to ensure it follows the proper format.
    
-   **Cash Register:** A program that calculates the total change due and the breakdown of currency to be given to a customer in a cash transaction.
